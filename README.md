#The pandemic has enlightened us in regards to how data is managed in the healthcare system. Data is not stored properly nor is it utilized accordingly. Data should be collected and recorded into a digital system that will allow us to know the conditions of the citizens and the medication they need. In times as critical as they are now, it's important to know those who have underlying conditions that result in them being at a higher risk of not surviving. This system could also rely on USSD capabilities to reach the citizens and inform them of any news on their risks, conditions or medication. Post pandemic, the system could offer vital information to the public, like reminders to observe good hygiene, finish the prescribed medication for it to be effective and even proper wound care after a patient has been sent home. The public needs a system that will remind them to take proper care of their health and that will cater to every individual.
